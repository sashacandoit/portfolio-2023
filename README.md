This is a personal portfolio site built using Create React App, highlighting some of my noteable projects and work experience.

## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience designing, testing, and building websites and web applications. Over the past two years, I have developed my skills and cultivated my passion for web development and programming through Springboard’s Software Engineering boot camp while directly applying my learning to freelance projects for non-profits and startups. 

With my 14+ years of experience as a Family Manager & Executive Administrator, I found a passion for building meaningful user experiences in both the digital and physical world. I’m a lifelong learner, and am always expanding my toolkit to effectively solve complex problems in efficient, elegant and human-centric ways.

TECH STACK: JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CSS, HTML, Git, Wordpress, Bootstrap, SQL, PostgreSQL, jQuery, REST API, Jasmine, Jest, React Testing Library

## Projects

#### Packable

A React web app that takes the guesswork out of the packing for a trip. By pulling from a location's past weather data, a user can enter their trip dates and destination, and see likely weather conditions for when they will be there. The app generates a template packing list based on the number of days the user will be traveling and the climate of their destination. The packing list can then be edited and saved to their user profile.

#### Style Guide Generator

Using Python and Flask, this web app automates the process of making brand guides for designers, generating a simple, editable style guide using a brand's color scheme, organizing font styles by their use, and displaying key styling requirements to guide designers in the rest of the branding process.

## Site Imporovements 

#### Responsiveness

* Mobile version still too large for most screens and needs to zoom out to view whole page
* Mobile menu sizing is based on screen size so doesn't fill whole screen when zoomed out
* When phones turn view to landscape mode, the size of sections behave as if they are being viewed on iPad, and heights of some sections end up too small. 

#### Project Previews

* Add image carousel to scroll through different screen views of projects

#### Dark Mode

* Add feature to switch between light and dark mode

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
